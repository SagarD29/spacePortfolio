    "summary": "LINKEDIN INFORMATION\nAbout\nI’m a Data and ML-focused Engineer with experience building real-time machine learning services, automated data pipelines and production-ready APIs. I enjoy taking complex technical problems and turning them into reliable, efficient systems that reduce manual work and deliver faster insights.\n\nMy recent work includes Python-based ETL pipelines processing more than 100,000 images a day, Apache Airflow DAGs with CI testing, and optimising YOLO and ResNet models for GPU deployment. I’ve also delivered Dockerised microservices, monitoring dashboards in Grafana and Prometheus, and workflow automation that improved operational efficiency for clients.\n\nI’m comfortable working across the full engineering stack – Python, SQL, Linux, Docker, GitLab CI/CD, REST APIs and AWS services – and I bring a practical understanding of data science and feature engineering to support model development and automation.\n\nI’m now looking for opportunities in Data Engineering, ML Engineering, Software Engineering or Process Automation where I can contribute to scalable systems, strengthen my engineering skills and continue building high-impact solutions.\nAll activity\n✨ Proud to share that I completed the Thames Moonlight 10 Mile Walk hosted by Ultra Challenge, raising funds for Parkinson’s UK!\n\nThis walk was especially meaningful, as it was in memory of my grandma Jyotshnabaa, who lived with Parkinson’s for over 4 years. \n\n🌧️ Despite the rain, every step was for a great cause close to my heart. As a team, we have raised over £3000 for Parkinson's UK.\n\n📊 Results I’m really proud of:\n- Time: 2 hrs 46 min 42 sec\n- Pace: 10.22 min/km\n- Finished in the Top 17 males and Top 60 out of 506 participants\n\n🏅 Crossing the finish line and receiving the medal was such a rewarding moment.\n\n👉 If you’d like to support Parkinson’s UK and their vital work, donations can be made here: https://lnkd.in/gD_-kdup\n\nA huge thank you to everyone who has supported me so far — it means the world! 💙\nhashtag#ThamesMoonlightWalk hashtag#UltraChallenge hashtag#ParkinsonsUK hashtag#CharityChallenge\n✨ Last night I had the opportunity to attend Product Evenings LDN: Agentic AI and Rewriting the Product Playbook, hosted by BrainStation.\n\nA big thank you to Anna Hyclak, Senior Product Manager, for an insightful talk on how Agentic AI is reshaping product strategy.\n\n🔑 Key takeaways:\n\n- Agents follow a perception → cognition → action cycle\n\n- Unlike traditional systems, agents are goal-oriented rather than just task-oriented\n\n- The importance of data quality: AI is only as good as the data you feed it → garbage in, garbage out\n\n- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is becoming essential for grounding AI systems with context and accuracy\n\nIt was inspiring to connect with so many product and AI enthusiasts, share ideas, and explore how this paradigm shift will impact the future of product development.\n\n💡 Excited to keep learning and experimenting with these concepts!\n\nhashtag#BrainStation hashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#AgenticAI hashtag#AI hashtag#Innovation\n🚀 Undergraduate dissertation milestone!\nI’ve just wrapped up my BEng (EEE) at the University of Surrey with a final-year project that pushes printed photovoltaics a step closer to real-world adoption:\n\nBar-coated, semitransparent perovskite solar cells ✨🔋\n\n🔍 Key results from the work\nMetric | Champion device | Average of 6 devices\nPower conversion efficiency (AM1.5 G, stabilised) | 5.4 % | 4.8 %\nVisible transmittance (380–780 nm, AVT) | 28 % | 27 %\nActive area | 1 cm² | —\nProcessing speed (single pass) | 120 mm s⁻¹ | —\n\nBar-coating delivered highly uniform films across 25 cm² substrates, demonstrating the scalability of the process for roll-to-roll lines. The semitransparency means the devices can double as power-generating window panes—ideal for building-integrated PV and smart façades.\nThis journey wouldn’t have been possible without the guidance of Ehsan Rezaee, PhD, Professor Ravi Silva FREng CBE and the inspiring team at Surrey’s Scaled Printing Laboratory (SPL). Check out the lab’s broader work here:\n\n🔗 https://lnkd.in/egrMAfVZ\n\nA big thank-you to everyone in the Advanced Technology Institute, and to friends & family for their unwavering support.\nI’m excited to keep exploring printed electronics, perovskites, and sustainable-energy solutions—if you’re working in these areas, let’s connect!\nhashtag#Perovskite hashtag#SolarEnergy hashtag#PrintedElectronics hashtag#Research hashtag#UniversityOfSurrey\nOn 25 June 2025 I was formally awarded a BEng (Hons) in Electronic Engineering with Upper Second-Class Honours by the University of Surrey.\n \nDuring the degree I dove deep into some truly inspiring modules, including: \n- Nanoscience & Nanoparticles – exploring materials at the atomic scale\n- Semiconductors & Optoelectronics – from device physics to LED/laser design\n- Robotics – building and programming autonomous systems\n- Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition – teaching machines to interpret the world\n\nFor my final-year dissertation, I developed transparent perovskite solar cells, investigating how high-efficiency, barely visible photovoltaics could be integrated into windows and display glass—work that reinforced my passion for sustainable, human-centred technology.\n\nWhat’s next? I’m eager to bring my skills in nano-fabrication, optoelectronic device engineering and machine-vision-driven robotics to an innovative engineering team. If your organisation is tackling exciting challenges in advanced materials, renewable energy or intelligent hardware, let’s connect!\n\nA heartfelt thank-you to my professors, mentors, family and friends for their unwavering support—this milestone is ours to share.\n\nhashtag#ElectronicEngineering hashtag#Nanotechnology hashtag#Optoelectronics hashtag#Robotics hashtag#ComputerVision hashtag#SolarEnergy hashtag#ClassOf2025 hashtag#UniversityOfSurrey\n🌟 Reflecting on a Year of Growth and Impact at Vision4ce 🌟\n\nAs I look back on the past year at Vision4ce, I’m proud of the many opportunities I’ve had to contribute to meaningful projects, develop new skills, and make a tangible impact on our workflows and systems.
