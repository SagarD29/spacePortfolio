  "summary": "I’m a Data and ML-focused Engineer with experience building real-time machine learning services, automated data pipelines and production-ready APIs. I enjoy taking complex technical problems and turning them into reliable, efficient systems that reduce manual work and deliver faster insights.\nMy recent work includes Python-based ETL pipelines processing more than 100,000 images a day, Apache Airflow DAGs with CI testing, and optimising YOLO and ResNet models for GPU deployment. I’ve also delivered Dockerised microservices, monitoring dashboards in Grafana and Prometheus, and workflow automation that improved operational efficiency for clients.\nI’m comfortable working across the full engineering stack – Python, SQL, Linux, Docker, GitLab CI/CD, REST APIs and AWS services – and I bring a practical understanding of data science and feature engineering to support model development and automation.\nI’m now looking for opportunities in Data Engineering, ML Engineering, Software Engineering or Process Automation where I can contribute to scalable systems, strengthen my engineering skills and continue building high-impact solutions.\n\nWEBSITE SUMMARY\n👋 Data Engineer | ML Automation Engineer | Software Engineer\nA highly skilled and versatile engineer with expertise in software development, machine learning, DevOps, and electrical engineering.
