The semitransparency means the devices can double as power-generating window panes—ideal for building-integrated PV and smart façades.\nThis journey wouldn’t have been possible without the guidance of Ehsan Rezaee, PhD, Professor Ravi Silva FREng CBE and the inspiring team at Surrey’s Scaled Printing Laboratory (SPL).
